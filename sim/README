--OVERVIEW--
This simulation requires iverilog to run.
The scripts directory contains the scripts and memory initialization files.
The tb directory contains testbenches for sources of this project. The top-level and
relevant testbench is 'matrixMult_testbench.v'.
The wf_config directory is home to wavefrom configuration files for this simulation.

--INSTRUCTIONS--
This simulation relys upon generated memory initialization files. In order to
generate and run the simulation, type 'make'.

To clean up any log files type, 'make clean'.

If one wishes to use non-default memory initialization files, the generation script can
produce any size and dimension inputs. To run simulation only and not generation, 
type 'make iver'.

To re-generate the default memory initialization files, type 'make gen'.
